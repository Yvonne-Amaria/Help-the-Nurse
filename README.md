# Help-the-Nurse
A classic shortest path algorithm created to help a travelling nurse. See attached help document and question for understanding.
Question:
The Problem

Mary is the only nurse in a rural community. She must travel many miles between patients and this leaves her exhausted most days. It would greatly help her to have a tool that would tell her the shortest route among the patients she must visit. Mary never knows how many patients she must visit but is always given the distances between patients. Maryâ€™s hospital has tried to be helpful by giving her a list like this:

 

Mary -> Henry = 4

Mary -> Jane = 6

Mary -> Quinn = 20

Henry -> Jane = 10

Quinn -> Jane = 8

 

The list is in the form:

Person A -> Person B = Distance between Person A and Person B

*If a distance is not given between patients, it is assumed that it is not possible to commute between them.

*The list is supplied to Mary in a .txt file called patientList.txt.

 

Your Task

- Use the patientList.txt file given by the hospital, to find the shortest route to the patients that Mary must visit.

- Your solution should cater for n number of patients.

- Your user-defined variables, functions, classes, and packages should end with your initials.
